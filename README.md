# Tandem
In 2018 a new cocktail bar was opened in Newtown. It brought the warm,
cosy feelings of Scandanavian bars and cafes to Sydney, embracing the concept of hygge.

This project was to stake a claim on the internet for this bar and allow for expanding upon later. 
The requirements were simply to get a landing page active on the domain that provided a contact email address.

We settled on a design that featured the logo, email address, street address and social media links. 
The website is responsive, accessible and fast to load. At the time of writing, this 
landing page has since been replaced by the owner with a WordPress site.

## Responsive Design
Keeping the design simple and utilising flex allows for a fully responsive design.

## Colour Preferences
Acknowledging the user's color preference prevents the late night shock of a bright website.
